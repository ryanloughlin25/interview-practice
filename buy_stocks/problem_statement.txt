write a function which accepts a list of integers as input.  The integers are prices of a given stock over the course of a day and they are in order.  The first element in the list is the opening price and the last element is the closing price.

The function should return the maximum possible profit if you can only buy and sell 1 share of that stock that day (you must buy before you sell).  You do not have to buy, if it is not possible to make money that day then the function should return 0.
