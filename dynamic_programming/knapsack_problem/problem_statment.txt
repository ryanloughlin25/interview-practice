Simplified Knapsack Problem:
Given a container of capacity W and a set of items i = {1, 2, ..., n} each of
size w_i, find the subset of items with highest total weight that fit in the
container. 

Knapsack Problem:
Consider that each item i additionally has a value v_i, and find
the subset of items of maximum total value that fits in the container.
