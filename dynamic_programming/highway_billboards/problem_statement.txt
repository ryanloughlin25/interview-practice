You are in charge of putting up billboards for your company on a stretch of
highway. There are n possible locations for billboards L = {l1, l2, ..., ln}
and each location has an associated revenue ri that you would receive from a
billboard in that location. However, zoning regulations (or whatever they have
for highways) stipulate that you cannot place billboards closer than 5 miles
from any other billboard. Given a set of locations L and their revenues, and
assuming that the locations are sorted in the order they appear on the highway
(say, from east to west), return valid set of locations with highest total
revenue in linear time.
