Given a list of tuples of the form (start_time, end_time), return a list of tuples where overlapping input tuples are combined.
The start_time/end_time couple be unix timestamps or just integers.
O(nlogn) time.

For example
input: [(0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 8), (10, 12), (9, 10)]
output: [(0, 1), (3, 8), (9, 12)]
