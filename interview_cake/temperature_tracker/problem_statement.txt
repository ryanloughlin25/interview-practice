Write a class with 5 functions - insert, max, min, mean, mode.
The data will be integers in the range [0, 110].
Insert does not need to return anything, mean should return a float, and the other functions should return integers.
If there are multiple modes then you can return any of them.
All 5 functions should be O(1) time and the entire class should use O(1) space.
