Find the intersection of two rectangles
You can assume the input will define valid rectangles
You can assume that every edge (of a rectangle) will be parallel with either the x or y axis
Each rectangle will be defined as a dictionary with the following format:
{
    'left_x': 1,
    'bottom_y': 5,
    'width': 10,
    'height': 4,
}
